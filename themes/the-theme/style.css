/*

The style.css file in WordPress is used as a source of information for wp-admin and the WP.org theme repo.
This file will not contain styling information, only the metadata needed to load the theme.

A few extra things to note:

- "Text Domain" below should match the theme directory and is used for translation
- "Tags" are not required for the theme but will be displayed in wp-admin
- Information on the fields below is here - https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css/
- A "Template" field can be added to make this theme a child theme - https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/
